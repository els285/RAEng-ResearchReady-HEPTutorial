# ML4HEP Tutorial

Landing page for University of Manchester Machine Learning for High-Energy Physics tutorial, part of a series for the RAEng Google DeepMind ResearchReady programme.

The session motivates the use of machine learning in high-energy physics research, particularly in the context of the Large Hadron Collider.
Several examples of various machine learning technologies, applied to particle physics research, are given.

A set of hands-on exericses are provided.
The main exercises use the [JetClass](https://zenodo.org/records/6619768) dataset, focusing on the classificaton of jet classes using DNNs on high-level jet features and transformers on low-level jet constituents.  See below
A set of introductory exercises aimed at those with less ML (and specifically PyTorch) experience can be found at [Intro2DNN4Physics](https://github.com/els285/Intro2NN4Physics/tree/main/Exercises).
